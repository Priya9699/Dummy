	Calling Multiple API's with RxJS Operators: 
		
calling multiple API :
    there are three ways to call multiple API's 
    1. Parellal calls : 
		API's are independent and run at a same time. 
			Operators: forkJoin, mergeMap, combineLatest 
    2. Sequential calls : 
		API's may dependent and run one after another based on previsous result. 
			Operators: concatMap, switchMap 
    3. Combine data from multiple API : 
		API's call independent and then combine result into one asset 
			Operators: merge , concat 
	
		parellal calls :
			--- api 1 ==> --- result1
			--- api 2 ==> --- result2
			--- api 3 ==> --- result3
			
		sequential calls: 
			---api 1  ---- api 2 --- api 3 ===> --- result1 --- result2 --- result3

		combininng mulitple calls: 
			---api 1 --- api 2 ---api 3 => -------  result
